                <p class="info">Have you ever been so busy that you wished you could clone yourself just to get everything done? That's the Gemini experience in a nutshell. Spontaneous, playful, and adorably erratic, Gemini is driven by its insatiable curiosity.

Cancers are highly intuitive and their psychic abilities manifest in tangible spaces. But‚Äîjust like the hard-shelled crustaceans‚Äîthis water sign is willing to do whatever it takes to protect itself emotionally. In order to get to know this sign, you're going to need to establish trust!

                <p class="info">You know the expression, "if you want something done, give it to a busy person?" Well, that definitely is the Virgo anthem. Virgos are logical, practical, and systematic in their approach to life. Virgo is an earth sign historically represented by the goddess of wheat and agriculture, an association that speaks to Virgo's deep-rooted presence in the material world. This earth sign is a perfectionist at heart and isn‚Äôt afraid to improve skills through diligent and consistent practice.

                <p class="info">Elusive and mysterious, Scorpio is one of the most misunderstood signs of the zodiac. Scorpio is a water sign that uses emotional energy as fuel, cultivating powerful wisdom through both the physical and unseen realms. In fact, Scorpio derives its extraordinary courage from its psychic abilities, which is what makes this sign one of the most complicated, dynamic signs of the zodiac.

Capricorn is climbing the mountain straight to the top and knows that patience, perseverance, and dedication is the only way to scale. The last earth sign of the zodiac, Capricorn, is represented by the sea-goat, a mythological creature with the body of a goat and the tail of a fish.

                <p class="info">Despite the "aqua" in its name, Aquarius is actually the last air sign of the zodiac. Innovative, progressive, and shamelessly revolutionary, Aquarius is represented by the water bearer, the mystical healer who bestows water, or life, upon the land. Accordingly, Aquarius is the most humanitarian astrological sign. At the end of the day, Aquarius is dedicated to making the world a better place.

                <p class="info">If you looked up the word "psychic" in the dictionary, there would definitely be a picture of Pisces next to it. Pisces is the most intuitive, sensitive, and empathetic sign of the entire zodiac ‚Äî and that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs the last of the last. As the final sign, Pisces has absorbed every lesson ‚Äî the joys and the pain, the hopes and the fears ‚Äî learned by all of the other signs. It's symbolized by two fish swimming in opposite directions, representing the constant division of Pisces' attention between fantasy and reality. Read your sign's full profile here.
